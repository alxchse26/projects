Scheme Lab 1: Intro Collaboration Doc

27 January 2026
* I consulted chatGPT to ask how I print my lists on a new line, and it showed me println. 
* I am having issues with #2. Since pear is in nested lists, the original program I wrote 
could not find the "pear" as follows:

(define (findPear x)
  (cond
    [(null? x) #f]
    [(equal? (car x) 'pear) '"pear found!"]
    [(list? (car x)) (findPear (car x))]
    [else (findPear (cdr x))]))

So I'm going to ask Bridget if she has any advice on how to deal with the nested lists. 
Since she went ahead and did this lab without me anyways...
