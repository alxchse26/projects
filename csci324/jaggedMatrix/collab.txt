Scheme Lab 5: Jagged Matrix Collaboration Doc


07 February 2026

I am now starting my jagged matrix function. It seems to be going well? My first error is in my sorted? Function:

 (define (sorted? lst)
    (cond
      [(null? lst) #t]
      [(null? (cdr lst)) #t]
      [(if (or (< (car lst) (cadr lst)))
               (= ((car lst) (cadr lst))))
           (sorted? (cdr lst))]
      [else #f]))

<: contract violation
  expected: real?
  given: (1 2 3)

I did ask Claude AI what the problem with the function was, and it was the if statement. So I removed the if altogether. Now I have an even crazier error:

. begin (possibly implicit): the last form is not an expression in: (define (sorted? lst) (cond ((null? lst) #t) ((null? (cdr lst)) #t) ((or (< (car lst) (cadr lst))) (= ((car lst) (cadr))) (sorted? (cdr lst))) (else #f)) (define (sumColumn n matrix) (cond ((null? matrix) 0) ((< (length (car matrix)) n) 0) (else (+ (list-ref (car matrix) (- n 1)) (sumColumn n (cdr matrix)))))) (begin (newline) (display "__________________________________") (newline) (display matrix) (newline) (cond ((sorted? matrix) (begin (display "Every Row is in sorted order.") (newline) (display "The sum of column ") (display n) (display " is ") (display (sumColumn n matrix)))) (else (display "The rows are not sorted."))) (newline)))

This turned out to be another syntax error. My program is now running, but coming back that every matrix is not sorted... Not sure why. 
[(null? matrix) #f] was returning false every time the recursive calls ended. Changing to #t fixed it. 

Now my program is almost complete, except I get an incorrect sum for the first question. The sum I am supposed to get is 7, but I get 3. 
In going step by step through the problem, I realize that my original function:

      [(null? matrix) 0]                         
      [(< (length (car matrix)) n) 0]               
      [else 
       (+ (list-ref (car matrix) (- n 1))        
          (sumColumn n (cdr matrix)))]))

ends the recursive calls on sumColumn by returning 0 when the row is too short. I will change it so that it just skips that row entirely and moves on to the next. 
Yay. My code is now working and giving the desired output.
