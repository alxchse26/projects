Scheme Lab 4: Magic Rows Collaboration Doc


07 February 2026

I have been working on this for a while now, but I believe I've made steady progress.  I have a feeling some of these functions might come out ugly/overcomplicated though. 

Obviously, we are supposed to use the sumAdd function we made in warmup to add the atoms in each row. Because this function was designed to handle nested lists, I am aware I must not pass the entire matrix as a parameter, but rather each row at a time. So for this reason, there must be a function to separate and pass each row to sumAdd. I am struggling with how to loop through each list to run sumAdd without iteration...

  (define (magicRows matrix)
    (cond
      [(null? matrix) '()]
      [else (car matrix)
             (cons listOfSums((sumAdd(car matrix))]))

Not sure where I should include the cdr here. It seems no one else is responding to me, so maybe I will send an email inquiry. Other than this, I feel pretty good about my other functions. I wrote my identical? checker and think it came out pretty well: 

  (define (identical? lst)
   (cond
    [(null? lst) #t]        
    [(= (car lst) (cadr lst)) 
     (identical? (cdr lst))]
    [else #f]))    

Between these three functions, I imagine I will be all set. 

Okay, coming back post-email. Your response was very helpful, because I realized that the function I need to run the cdr on is the magicRows function, not sumAdd. Adjusting that gave me:

(define (magicRows matrix)
    (cond
      [(null? matrix) '()]     
      [else (cons (sumAdd (car matrix))     
             (magicRows (cdr matrix)))])) 

Now it is time to run!

My numRows is coming back with the following error:

(define numRows (length(matrix)))
application: not a procedure;
 expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
  given: ((1 2 3 4 5) (2 3 4 5 1) (3 4 5 1 2) (4 5 1 2 3) (5 1 2 3 4))

I changed it to (length(car matrix)), but that hasn't changed anything. Oh wait. It is a syntax error. 
Wow I was expecting many more errors, but it seems it is working well. My output matches the desired submit. Yay.
