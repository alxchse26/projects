I consulted chatGPT to ask how I print my lists on a new line, and it showed me println.
I am having issues with #2. Since pear is in nested lists, the original program I wrote could not find the "pear" as follows:

(define (findPear x)
  (cond
    [(null? x) #f]
    [(equal? (car x) 'pear) '"pear found!"]
    [(list? (car x)) (findPear (car x))]
    [else (findPear (cdr x))]))

and returns:
  "Finding 'pear' in list1..."
  "pear found!"
  "Finding 'pear' in list2..."
  #f
  "Finding 'pear' in list3..."
  #f

After giving this some time to simmer, and doing a run through, I feel like the (car x) that follows
equal? and list? is counterintuitive because we don't need to recurse when asking if the given element is equal or a list. So I switched that to an x. Still fails though. Now all return #f...

After looking ahead in the slides and cosulting Claude on how to use or, I realize this does not behave the way I want. If the item is a list, I want to try the first element (car x), and if that returns #f, THEN try the rest (cdr x). That helped me a lot because I came up with the structure:

[(list? x)
     (or (findPear (car x))
         (findPear (cdr x)))]
     [else #f]

Which ended up working out for all of the lists.

I did the second part of the project well on my own. I ended up with this:

(define (keep-first-n list n)
  (cond
    ((< n 0) (display "n must not be negative!"))
    (or (= n 0)
        (null? list) ('()))
    (else (cons(car list))
          (keep-first-n (cdr list) (- n 1)))))

Although I couldn't figure out how to use the or. So I asked Bridget about how she used "or" and she said she didn't have to...
Nevermind it's still not behaving, how I want so I will go to office hours and submit there.

Office hours made me realize I did way too much for the first part. My apologies.
